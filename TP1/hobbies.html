                Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has been the club's home ground since April 2019, 
                replacing their former home of White Hart Lane, 
                which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site.
                Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross in the London Borough of Enfield.

                Tottenham have played in a first (home) strip of white shirts and navy blue shorts since the 1898â€“99 season. 
                The club's emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football, 
                with a Latin motto Audere est Facere <i><b>"To Dare Is to Do"</b></i>.
